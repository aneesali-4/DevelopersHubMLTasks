AI/ML Internship Tasks â€“ Developers Hub
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for completed machine learning tasks as part of my AI/ML Internship at Developers Hub. Each notebook is self-contained and demonstrates core data science skills including data cleaning, visualization, model building, and evaluation.

Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset
Task Objective:
Understand basic data exploration using the Iris dataset by loading, inspecting, and visualizing data trends and distributions.

Dataset Used:
Iris dataset (loaded via Seaborn's built-in dataset)

Models Applied:
No model training (EDA-only task)

Key Results and Findings:

Pairplots showed clear separation between species based on petal length and width.

Boxplots revealed setosa species has significantly lower petal dimensions.

Histograms showed most features are normally distributed.

Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction
Task Objective:
Predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on clinical health data.

Dataset Used:
UCI Heart Disease Dataset (heart.csv from Kaggle: Ronitf Dataset)

Models Applied:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Key Results and Findings:

Achieved high accuracy with Logistic Regression after proper preprocessing.

ROC-AUC curve showed good model performance.

Features like cp, thalach, and oldpeak were most predictive of heart disease.

Task 6: House Price Prediction
Task Objective:
Predict house prices using property features such as size, bedrooms, and location.

Dataset Used:
Kaggle House Price Prediction Dataset (kc_house_data.csv)

Models Applied:
Linear Regression
Gradient Boosting Regressor

Key Results and Findings:
Gradient Boosting achieved better MAE and RMSE than Linear Regression.
Important features included sqft_living, grade, and location.
Predictions closely aligned with actual values, as seen in visual comparison plots.

Tools & Libraries Used
Python, Jupyter Notebook
pandas, numpy
seaborn, matplotlib
